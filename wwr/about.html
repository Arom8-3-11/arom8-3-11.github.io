                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>It started off with just a group of friends who loved doing outdoor activities together. While taking a small journey into the mountains to find a river to float on, the group found a fairly calm river that seemed pretty easy to go down. What they didn't know was that there would be many twists and turns later on that were deemed dangerous because of the white rapids. When they ran into them, there was a sense of fear and thrill amongst the group, but all of them managed to come back safely. Splash was created in order to help teach others about how to safely navigate these types of waters while possibly feeling slight fear, but to also help feel the excitement when guided through properly.</p>
