<!-- Intro to the css basic box model -->

<!-- if box-sizing is set to "content-box" and element is a bloc element, content area's size can be explicitly defined with width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height, and max-height -->
  
<!-- padding area:  -->
      <!-- padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left, and shorthand padding properties -->

<!-- Border area: -->
      <!-- border-width, shorthand border, box-sizing is set to border-box, area's size can be explicitly defined with the width, min-width, max-width, height, min-height, and max-height -->
      <!-- If  background is present, set on a box, default behavior can be altered with the "background-clip" CSS property -->

<!-- Margin area: -->
      <!-- margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left, and shorthand margin -->
      <!-- if margin collapsing occurs the margin area is not clearly defined since margins are shared between boxes -->
      <!-- non-replaced inline elements, the amount of space taken up is determined by the line-height property, even thought the borders and padding are still displayed around the content -->
