                    <p>Hello! My name is Audrey Romrell. I live in Montana, USA where I like to enjoy the beautiful scenery and go on hikes whenever it is not too cold! I am currently working at Hobby Lobby where I like to work with others to help create a healthy environment while helping customers who are shopping in the store. Something that I also love to do is to draw and read. When I draw, I use several different mediums such as digital, pen/pencil, markers, etc. Things that I like to draw as well as reading is fantasy and historical fiction genres.</p>
