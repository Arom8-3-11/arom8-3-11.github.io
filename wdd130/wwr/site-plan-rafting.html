            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Ready for a wild adventure? Here at Splash, we provide the most wonderful experience rafting a few different skills and courses with varying difficulties. Our goal is to help provide information for you and your friends with a joyful time and learning how to navigate the rough waters in nature.</p>

            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>How old do you have to be? - As long as you are 12 years or older you can be on any of the courses. Anyone under 12 are allowed to be on courses that are classes one to three with a legal guardian.</p>
            <p>What should be expected? - While rafting, you are more than likely to get wet throughout the course, so it is advised to bring clothes to change into both for in the course and when done. If you do not have any type of wet wear you can change into, we do have rental ones we may provide you with.</p>
            <p>Anything that I need to be careful of? - In case of falling off the raft, it is important to know how to swim. While this is a really fun experience, it can also be dangerous. We emphasize how important it is to listen to our guides for instruction in case of emergency and for safety measures while in the raft. Each guide has been provided with the skills and liscences to help ensure the safety of everyone that is on the raft. In case something does happen, the guides will do their best to help you reach safety.</p>
